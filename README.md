# Quax Project

In this page we show the result of the analysis about [the search for galactic axions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07505). 
Starting from the data collected by INFN we have analysed them with the same procedure utilised in [LHC for the Higgs boson search](http://cds.cern.ch/record/1379837/?ln=it), both files are available in the **ref** folder and the INFN dataset is in **db**.

In the first part we have taken a single run to study. In **Statistics.ipynb** we show the statistical procedure, in **fitFunc.ipynb** the functions for the background and the signal fit, in **prepData.ipynb** the procedure to take the raw excel, zoom in around the cavity frequency and scale the data. In the end we have summarised the results in the **SingleRunAnalysis.ipynb** notebook.

In the **MultipleRunAnalysis** folder there is the same analysis made with the whole dataset with different cavity frequency.
